# Cryptotron Three Thousand
This was a project where as a team we tried to implement different encryption alogrithms, and then try and decrypt some given texts without a key.

We implemented a few alogirthms 
  * Ceaser
  * Simple Substitution
  * Fiestal
  * Local Transposition
  * Playfair
  * RSA
  * Vigenere
